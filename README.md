or extracting the zip file dashboard contents to your newly created folder.
Secondly, navigate your way to this directory/ your newly created folder via the terminal and
run npm install first to install all the dependencies next run npm install gulp ( if you have
already installed the Node.js and gulp globally then just run gulp)
“this process will create the environment into a development environment”
